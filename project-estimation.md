# Intro
- Double Your Estimation
- Formula: (O + 4 M + P) / 6.
    - O = Optimistic
    - P = Pessimistic
    - M = Most likely
- Hereâ€™s an example of a productivity consulting project I led for a client last year:
  - Optimistic estimate = 3 weeks
  - Likely estimate = 6 weeks
  - Pessimistic estimate = 12 weeks
