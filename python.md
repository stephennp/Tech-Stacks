# Intro

# Compiler vs Interpreter

- All the programming languages are converted to machine understandable language for execution. The conversion is taken care of by `compilers and interpreters`.

- Let us consider an example of Italian movie. For a person, who doesn’t understand italian and can understand English, there will be two ways to watch the movie. First way is to watch a English dubbed version of the movie, if available. Second way is to watch the italian movie with english subtitles. In the second way, the subtitles are displayed scene by scene separately whereas in the first way all the scenes are converted to english. We can compare the first scenario with the compiler and the second one with the interpreter.

- A compiler is one which takes the source code and converts it into machine executable code at once. The processor takes the executable and executes it. The languages which use a compiler are called compiled languages. Compiled languages are faster and more efficient comparatively. Examples – Java, C++

- An interpreter is one which runs the code line by line and executes instruction by instruction. The languages which use interpreters are called Interpreted languages. Such languages are slower in terms of execution and less efficient. Examples – PHP, Python, Ruby

# Scripting language

A scripting language is a programming language which is interpreted. These types of languages are used in automations, etc. These languages use interpreters and are executed line by line.

# Features of Python

- Simple: Python syntax is very easy. Developing and understanding python is very easy than others. The below comparison illustrated how simple python language is when compared to other languages.

- Open Source – We can download freely and customise the code as well

- Dynamically typed – Dynamically type will be assigned to data.

- Platform independent: Python programs are not dependent on any specific operating systems. We can run on all operating systems happily.

- Portable: If a program gives the same result on any platform then it is a portable program. Python used to give the same result on any platform.

- Huge library – Python has a big library to fulfil the requirements.

- Database connectivity – Python provides interfaces to connect with all major databases like, oracle, MySQL

- Batteries included – Python provides inbuilt libraries called batteries. Some of them are below
  - Boto – amazon web services library
  - MySQL-connector-python – To connect with MySQL
  - NumPy – To process arrays
  - Pandas – powerful data structures for data analysis, time series and statistics

# Where all python is used?

- Python is being used to develop:

  - Standalone applications: An application which needs to install on every machine to work with that application.
  - Web applications: An application which follows client-server architecture. Client is a program, which sends requests to the server. Server is a program, mainly it can do three things. Captures the request from client, Process the request, and Sends the response to the client
    Database applications.
  - To process huge amounts of data. Ex Hadoop, Spark.
  - Machine learning.
  - Artificial Intelligence.
  - Data science.
  - Network servers.
  - IOT
  - Application scripting etc.

# Python supports

- Functional programming as well as Object oriented programming approach.
- Initial languages like C, Pascal or FORTRAN follow functional approaches.
- C++, Java and dot net follow an object-oriented approach.
- Python follows both functional and object-oriented approaches.
