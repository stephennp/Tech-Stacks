# Intro

# Containers
- The `.container class` provides a responsive fixed width container
- The `.container-fluid` class provides a full width container, spanning the entire width of the viewport
## Fixed Container
- Use the `.container` class to create a responsive, fixed-width container.
Note that its width (max-width) will change on different screen sizes:
```
Extra small
<576px	Small
≥576px	Medium
≥768px	Large
≥992px	Extra large
≥1200px

```
## Fluid Container
Use the `.container-fluid` class to create a full width container, that will always span the entire width of the screen (width is always 100%):

## Container Padding
By default, containers have `15px left and right padding`, with `no` top or bottom padding. Therefore, we often use spacing utilities, such as extra padding and margins to make them look even better. For example, .pt-3 means "add a top padding of 16px":
