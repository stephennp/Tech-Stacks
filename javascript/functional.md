# Intro

## Learn About Functional Programming

- Functional programming is a style of programming where solutions are simple, isolated functions, without any side effects outside of the function scope.

```
INPUT -> PROCESS -> OUTPUT
```

- Functional programming is about:

  - **Isolated functions** - there is no dependence on the state of the program, which includes global variables that are subject to change
  - **Pure functions** - the same input always gives the same output
  - **Functions with limited side effects** - any changes, or mutations, to the state of the program outside the function are carefully controlled

## Understand Functional Programming Terminology

- The FCC Team had a mood swing and now wants two types of tea: green tea and black tea. General Fact: Client mood swings are pretty common.

- With that information, we'll need to revisit the getTea function from last challenge to handle various tea requests. We can modify getTea to accept a function as a parameter to be able to change the type of tea it prepares. This makes getTea more flexible, and gives the programmer more control when client requests change.

- But first, let's cover some functional terminology:

- `Callbacks` are the functions that are slipped or passed into another function to decide the invocation of that function. You may have seen them passed to other methods, for example in filter, the callback function tells JavaScript the criteria for how to filter an array.

- Functions that can be assigned to a variable, passed into another function, or returned from another function just like any other normal value, are called first class functions. In JavaScript, all functions are first class functions.

- The functions that take a function as an argument, or return a function as a return value are called higher order functions.

- When the functions are passed in to another function or returned from another function, then those functions which gets passed in or returned can be called a lambda.

- Prepare 27 cups of green tea and 13 cups of black tea and store them in tea4GreenTeamFCC and tea4BlackTeamFCC variables, respectively. Note that the getTea function has been modified so it now takes a function as the first argument.

```javascript
// Function that returns a string representing a cup of green tea
const prepareGreenTea = () => "greenTea";

// Function that returns a string representing a cup of black tea
const prepareBlackTea = () => "blackTea";

/*
Given a function (representing the tea type) and number of cups needed, the
following function returns an array of strings (each representing a cup of
a specific type of tea).
*/
const getTea = (prepareTea, numOfCups) => {
  const teaCups = [];

  for (let cups = 1; cups <= numOfCups; cups += 1) {
    const teaCup = prepareTea();
    teaCups.push(teaCup);
  }
  return teaCups;
};

// Only change code below this line
const tea4GreenTeamFCC = getTea(prepareGreenTea, 27);
const tea4BlackTeamFCC = getTea(prepareBlackTea, 13);
// Only change code above this line

console.log(tea4GreenTeamFCC, tea4BlackTeamFCC);
```

## Avoid Mutations and Side Effects Using Functional Programming

- If you haven't already figured it out, the issue in the previous challenge was with the splice call in the `tabClose()` function. Unfortunately, `splice` changes the `original` array it is called on, so the second call to it used a `modified` array, and gave unexpected results.

- This is a small example of a much larger pattern - you call a function on a variable, array, or an object, and the function changes the variable or something in the object.

- One of the core principles of functional programming is to not change things. Changes lead to bugs. It's easier to prevent bugs knowing that your functions don't change anything, including the function arguments or any global variable.

- The previous example didn't have any complicated operations but the splice method changed the original array, and resulted in a bug.

- Recall that in functional programming, changing or altering things is called mutation, and the outcome is called a `side effect`. A function, ideally, should be a pure function, meaning that it does not cause any side effects.

```javascript
// The global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

function incrementer() {
  // Only change code below this line
  var incrementer = fixedValue;
  incrementer += 1;
  return incrementer;

  // Only change code above this line
}
```

## Pass Arguments to Avoid External Dependence in a Function

- The last challenge was a step closer to functional programming principles, but there is still something missing.

- We didn't alter the global variable value, but the function incrementer would not work without the global variable fixedValue being there.

- Another principle of functional programming is to always declare your dependencies explicitly. This means if a function depends on a variable or object being present, then pass that variable or object directly into the function as an argument.

- There are several good consequences from this principle. The function is easier to test, you know exactly what input it takes, and it won't depend on anything else in your program.

- This can give you more confidence when you alter, remove, or add new code. You would know what you can or cannot change and you can see where the potential traps are.

- Finally, the function would always produce the same output for the same set of inputs, no matter what part of the code executes it.

```javascript
// The global variable
var fixedValue = 4;

// Only change code below this line
function incrementer(increment) {
  increment += 1;
  return increment;

  // Only change code above this line
}

console.log(incrementer(fixedValue));
console.log(fixedValue);
```

## Refactor Global Variables Out of FunctionsPassed

- So far, we have seen two distinct principles for functional programming:

- Don't alter a variable or object - create new variables and objects and return them if need be from a function. Hint: using something like var newArr = arrVar, where arrVar is an array will simply create a reference to the existing variable and not a copy. So changing a value in newArr would change the value in arrVar.

- Declare function parameters - any computation inside a function depends only on the arguments passed to the function, and not on any global object or variable.

- Adding one to a number is not very exciting, but we can apply these principles when working with arrays or more complex objects.

```javascript
// The global variable
var bookList = [
  "The Hound of the Baskervilles",
  "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies",
  "PhilosophiÃ¦ Naturalis Principia Mathematica",
  "Disquisitiones Arithmeticae",
];

// Change code below this line
function add(bookList, bookName) {
  let copyBookList = bookList.splice(0);
  copyBookList.push(bookName);
  return copyBookList;

  // Change code above this line
}

// Change code below this line
function remove(bookName) {
  let copyBookList = bookList.splice(0);
  var book_index = copyBookList.indexOf(bookName);
  if (book_index >= 0) {
    copyBookList.splice(book_index, 1);
    return copyBookList;

    // Change code above this line
  }
}

var newBookList = add(bookList, "A Brief History of Time");
var newerBookList = remove(bookList, "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies");
var newestBookList = remove(
  add(bookList, "A Brief History of Time"),
  "On The Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies"
);

console.log(bookList);
```

## Use the map Method to Extract Data from an ArrayPassed

- So far we have learned to use pure functions to avoid side effects in a program. Also, we have seen the value in having a function only depend on its input arguments.

- This is only the beginning. As its name suggests, functional programming is centered around a theory of functions.

- It would make sense to be able to pass them as arguments to other functions, and return a function from another function. Functions are considered first class objects in JavaScript, which means they can be used like any other object. They can be saved in variables, stored in an object, or passed as function arguments.

- Let's start with some simple array functions, which are methods on the array object prototype. In this exercise we are looking at Array.prototype.map(), or more simply map.

- The map method iterates over each item in an array and returns a new array containing the results of calling the callback function on each element. It does this without mutating the original array.

- When the callback is used, it is passed three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the map method was called.

- See below for an example using the map method on the users array to return a new array containing only the names of the users as elements. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "John", age: 34 },
  { name: "Amy", age: 20 },
  { name: "camperCat", age: 10 },
];

const names = users.map((user) => user.name);
console.log(names); // [ 'John', 'Amy', 'camperCat' ]
```

## Implement map on a Prototype

- As you have seen from applying Array.prototype.map(), or simply map() earlier, the map method returns an array of the same length as the one it was called on. It also doesn't alter the original array, as long as its callback function doesn't.

- In other words, map is a pure function, and its output depends solely on its inputs. Plus, it takes another function as its argument.

- You might learn a lot about the map method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().

```javascript
// The global variable
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myMap = function (callback) {
  var newArray = [];
  // Only change code below this line
  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    newArray.push(callback(s[i]));
  }

  // Only change code above this line
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myMap(function (item) {
  return item * 2;
});
```

## Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array

- Another useful array function is `Array.prototype.filter()`, or simply `filter()`.

- filter calls a function on each element of an array and returns a new array containing only the elements for which that function returns true. In other words, it filters the array, based on the function passed to it. Like map, it does this without needing to modify the original array.

- The callback function accepts three arguments. The first argument is the current element being processed. The second is the index of that element and the third is the array upon which the filter method was called.

- See below for an example using the filter method on the users array to return a new array containing only the users under the age of 30. For simplicity, the example only uses the first argument of the callback.

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "John", age: 34 },
  { name: "Amy", age: 20 },
  { name: "camperCat", age: 10 },
];

const usersUnder30 = users.filter((user) => user.age < 30);
console.log(usersUnder30); // [ { name: 'Amy', age: 20 }, { name: 'camperCat', age: 10 } ]
```

## Implement the filter Method on a Prototype

- You might learn a lot about the filter method if you implement your own version of it. It is recommended you use a for loop or Array.prototype.forEach().

- Write your own Array.prototype.myFilter(), which should behave exactly like Array.prototype.filter(). You should not use the built-in filter method. The Array instance can be accessed in the myFilter method using this.

```javascript
// The global variable
var s = [23, 65, 98, 5];

Array.prototype.myFilter = function (callback) {
  // Only change code below this line
  var newArray = [];
  // Only change code above this line

  for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
    if (callback(s[i])) {
      newArray.push(s[i]);
    }
  }
  return newArray;
};

var new_s = s.myFilter(function (item) {
  return item % 2 === 1;
});
```

## Return Part of an Array Using the slice Method

- The slice method returns a copy of certain elements of an array. It can take two arguments, the first gives the index of where to begin the slice, the second is the index for where to end the slice (and it's non-inclusive). If the arguments are not provided, the default is to start at the beginning of the array through the end, which is an easy way to make a copy of the entire array. The slice method does not mutate the original array, but returns a new one.

Here's an example:

```javascript
var arr = ["Cat", "Dog", "Tiger", "Zebra"];
var newArray = arr.slice(1, 3);
// Sets newArray to ["Dog", "Tiger"]
```

## Remove Elements from an Array Using slice Instead of splice

- A common pattern while working with arrays is when you want to remove items and keep the rest of the array. JavaScript offers the splice method for this, which takes arguments for the index of where to start removing items, then the number of items to remove. If the second argument is not provided, the default is to remove items through the end. However, the splice method mutates the original array it is called on. Here's an example:

```javascript
var cities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
cities.splice(3, 1); // Returns "London" and deletes it from the cities array
// cities is now ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "Berlin"]
```

- As we saw in the last challenge, `the slice method does not mutate the original array`, but returns a new one which can be saved into a variable. Recall that the slice method takes two arguments for the indices to begin and end the slice (the end is non-inclusive), and returns those items in a new array. Using the slice method instead of splice helps to avoid any array-mutating side effects.

```javascript
function nonMutatingSplice(cities) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return cities.slice(0, 3);

  // Only change code above this line
}
var inputCities = ["Chicago", "Delhi", "Islamabad", "London", "Berlin"];
nonMutatingSplice(inputCities);
```

## Combine Two Arrays Using the concat Method

- Concatenation means to join items end to end. JavaScript offers the concat method for both strings and arrays that work in the same way.
- For arrays, the method is called on one, then another array is provided as the argument to concat, which is added to the end of the first array. It returns `a new array and does not mutate` either of the original arrays. Here's an example:

```javascript
[1, 2, 3].concat([4, 5, 6]);
// Returns a new array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```

## Add Elements to the End of an Array Using concat Instead of push

- Functional programming is all about creating and using non-mutating functions.

- The last challenge introduced the concat method as a way to combine arrays into a new one without mutating the original arrays. Compare concat to the push method. Push adds an item to the end of the same array it is called on, which mutates that array. Here's an example:

```javascript
var arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push([4, 5, 6]);
// arr is changed to [1, 2, 3, [4, 5, 6]]
// Not the functional programming way
```

- Concat offers a way to add new items to the end of an array without any mutating side effects.

```javascript
function nonMutatingPush(original, newItem) {
  // Only change code below this line
  var result = original.concat(newItem);
  console.log(result);
  console.log(original);
  return result;
  // Only change code above this line
}
var first = [1, 2, 3];
var second = [4, 5];
nonMutatingPush(first, second);
```

## Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data

- `Array.prototype.reduce(), or simply reduce()`, is the most general of all array operations in JavaScript. You can solve almost any array processing problem using the reduce method.

- The reduce method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it's possible to show that both filter and map can be derived as special applications of reduce. The reduce method iterates over each item in an array and returns a single value (i.e. string, number, object, array). This is achieved via a callback function that is called on each iteration.

- The callback function accepts four arguments. The first argument is known as the accumulator, which gets assigned the return value of the callback function from the previous iteration, the second is the current element being processed, the third is the index of that element and the fourth is the array upon which reduce is called.

- In addition to the callback function, reduce has an additional parameter which takes an initial value for the accumulator. If this second parameter is not used, then the first iteration is skipped and the second iteration gets passed the first element of the array as the accumulator.

- See below for an example using reduce on the users array to return the sum of all the users' ages. For simplicity, the example only uses the first and second arguments.

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "John", age: 34 },
  { name: "Amy", age: 20 },
  { name: "camperCat", age: 10 },
];

const sumOfAges = users.reduce((sum, user) => sum + user.age, 0);
console.log(sumOfAges); // 64
```

- In another example, see how an object can be returned containing the names of the users as properties with their ages as values.

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "John", age: 34 },
  { name: "Amy", age: 20 },
  { name: "camperCat", age: 10 },
];

const usersObj = users.reduce((obj, user) => {
  obj[user.name] = user.age;
  return obj;
}, {});
console.log(usersObj); // { John: 34, Amy: 20, camperCat: 10 }
```

## Use the reduce Method to Analyze Data

- Array.prototype.reduce(), or simply reduce(), is the most general of all array operations in JavaScript. You can solve almost any array processing problem using the reduce method.

- The reduce method allows for more general forms of array processing, and it's possible to show that both filter and map can be derived as special applications of reduce.

  { name: "Amy", age: 20 },
  { name: "camperCat", age: 10 },
];

const sumOfAges = users.reduce((sum, user) => sum + user.age, 0);
console.log(sumOfAges); // 64
```

- In another example, see how an object can be returned containing the names of the users as properties with their ages as values.

```javascript
const users = [
  { name: "John", age: 34 },
  { name: "Amy", age: 20 },
  { name: "camperCat", age: 10 },
];

const usersObj = users.reduce((obj, user) => {
  obj[user.name] = user.age;
  return obj;
}, {});
console.log(usersObj); // { John: 34, Amy: 20, camperCat: 10 }
```

```javascript
function getRating(watchList) {
  // Only change code below this line
  var filterList = watchList.map((res) => {
    if (res.Director == "Christopher Nolan") {
      return res.imdbRating;
    }
  });
  filterList = filterList.splice(0, filterList.length - 1);
  var averageRating = filterList.reduce((obj, val) => {
    return obj + Number(val);
  }, 0);

  // Only change code above this line
  return averageRating / filterList.length;
}
```

## Sort an Array Alphabetically using the sort Method

- The sort method sorts the elements of an array according to the callback function.

- For example:

```javascript
function ascendingOrder(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function (a, b) {
    return a - b;
  });
}
ascendingOrder([1, 5, 2, 3, 4]);
// Returns [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

function reverseAlpha(arr) {
  return arr.sort(function (a, b) {
    return a === b ? 0 : a < b ? 1 : -1;
  });
}
reverseAlpha(["l", "h", "z", "b", "s"]);
// Returns ['z', 's', 'l', 'h', 'b']
```

- JavaScript's default sorting method is by string Unicode point value, which may return unexpected results. Therefore, it is encouraged to provide a callback function to specify how to sort the array items. When such a callback function, normally called compareFunction, is supplied, the array elements are sorted according to the return value of the compareFunction: If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value less than 0 for two elements a and b, then a will come before b. If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value greater than 0 for two elements a and b, then b will come before a. If compareFunction(a,b) returns a value equal to 0 for two elements a and b, then a and b will remain unchanged.

## Apply Functional Programming to Convert Strings to URL Slugs

- The last several challenges covered a number of useful array and string methods that follow functional programming principles. We've also learned about reduce, which is a powerful method used to reduce problems to simpler forms. From computing averages to sorting, any array operation can be achieved by applying it. Recall that map and filter are special cases of reduce.

- Let's combine what we've learned to solve a practical problem.

- Many content management sites (CMS) have the titles of a post added to part of the URL for simple bookmarking purposes. For example, if you write a Medium post titled "Stop Using Reduce", it's likely the URL would have some form of the title string in it (".../stop-using-reduce"). You may have already noticed this on the freeCodeCamp site.

```javascript
// Only change code below this line
function urlSlug(title) {
  var ar = title.split(/\W+/);
  console.log(ar);
  ar = ar.reduce((acc, value) => {
    if (acc) {
      return acc + "-" + value;
    }
    return value;
  }, "");
  return ar.toLowerCase().trim();
}

// Only change code above this line
urlSlug(" Winter Is  Coming");
```

## Use the every Method to Check that Every Element in an Array Meets a Criteria

- The every method works with arrays to check if every element passes a particular test. It returns a Boolean value - true if all values meet the criteria, false if not.

- For example, the following code would check if every element in the numbers array is less than 10:

```javascript
var numbers = [1, 5, 8, 0, 10, 11];
numbers.every(function (currentValue) {
  return currentValue < 10;
});
// Returns false
```

## Use the some Method to Check that Any Elements in an Array Meet a Criteria

- The some method works with arrays to check if any element passes a particular test. `It returns a Boolean value - true if any of the values meet the criteria, false if not`.

- For example, the following code would check if any element in the numbers array is less than 10:

```javascript
var numbers = [10, 50, 8, 220, 110, 11];
numbers.some(function (currentValue) {
  return currentValue < 10;
});
// Returns true
```

## Introduction to Currying and Partial Application

- The arity of a function is the number of arguments it requires. Currying a function means to convert a function of N arity into N functions of arity 1.

- In other words, it restructures a function so it takes one argument, then returns another function that takes the next argument, and so on.

- Here's an example:

```javascript
//Un-curried function
function unCurried(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

//Curried function
function curried(x) {
  return function (y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}
//Alternative using ES6
const curried = (x) => (y) => x + y;

curried(1)(2); // Returns 3
```

- This is useful in your program if you can't supply all the arguments to a function at one time. You can save each function call into a variable, which will hold the returned function reference that takes the next argument when it's available. Here's an example using the curried function in the example above:

```javascript
// Call a curried function in parts:
var funcForY = curried(1);
console.log(funcForY(2)); // Prints 3
Similarly, partial application can be described as applying a few arguments to a function at a time and returning another function that is applied to more arguments. Here's an example:

//Impartial function
function impartial(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}
var partialFn = impartial.bind(this, 1, 2);
partialFn(10); // Returns 13
```
