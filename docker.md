# Intro
- Docker is an open-source project for automating the deployment of applications as portable, self-sufficient containers that can run on the cloud or on-premises

## Registries
- The registry is like a bookshelf where images are stored and available to be pulled for building containers to run services or web app
- Docker maintains a public registry via `Docker Hub`; other vendors provide registries for different collections of images, including `Azure Container Registry`

## Images
- Lets you store static and immutable application bits, including all their dependencies at a framework level
- Those images can then be versioned and deployed in multiple environments and therefore provide a consistent deployment unit

## Containers
- To run the app or service, the app's image is instantiated to create a container, which will be running on the Docker host.
- Containers are initially tested in a development environment or PC.

## Window containers
### 1. Windows Server Containers
### 2. Hyper-V Containers
