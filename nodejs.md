# Intro

- Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to write backend (server-side) programs in JavaScript. Node.js comes with a handful of built-in modules - small, independent programs - that help facilitate this purpose. Some of the core modules include:

  - HTTP: a module that acts as a server
  - File System: a module that reads and modifies files
  - Path: a module for working with directory and file paths
  - Assertion Testing: a module that checks code against prescribed constraints
  - Express, while not included with Node.js, is another module often used with it. Express runs between the server created by Node.js and the frontend pages of a web application. Express also handles an application's routing. Routing directs users to the correct page based on their interaction with the application. While there are alternatives to using Express, its simplicity makes it a good place to begin when learning the interaction between a backend powered by Node.js and the frontend.

## Start a Working Express Server

- In the first two lines of the file myApp.js, you can see how easy it is to create an Express app object. This object has several methods, and you will learn many of them in these challenges. One fundamental method is `app.listen(port)`. It tells your server to listen on a given port, putting it in running state. For testing reasons, we need the app to be running in the background so we added this method in the server.js file for you.

- Let’s serve our first string! In Express, routes takes the following structure: app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER). METHOD is an http method in lowercase. PATH is a relative path on the server (it can be a string, or even a regular expression). HANDLER is a function that Express calls when the route is matched. Handlers take the form function(req, res) {...}, where req is the request object, and res is the response object. For example, the handler

```javascript
function(req, res) {
  res.send('Response String');
}
```

will serve the string 'Response String'.

- Use the `app.get()` method to serve the string "Hello Express" to GET requests matching the `/` (root) path. Be sure that your code works by looking at the logs, then see the results in the preview if you are using Repl.it.

Note: All the code for these lessons should be added in between the few lines of code we have started you off with.

## Serve an HTML File

You can respond to requests with a file using the res.sendFile(path) method. You can put it inside the app.get('/', ...) route handler. Behind the scenes, this method will set the appropriate headers to instruct your browser on how to handle the file you want to send, according to its type. Then it will read and send the file. This method needs an absolute file path. We recommend you to use the Node global variable `\_\_dirname` to calculate the path like this:

absolutePath = \_\_dirname + relativePath/file.ext
Send the /views/index.html file as a response to GET requests to the / path. If you view your live app, you should see a big HTML heading (and a form that we will use later…), with no style applied.

Note: You can edit the solution of the previous challenge or create a new one. If you create a new solution, keep in mind that Express evaluates routes from top to bottom, and executes the handler for the first match. You have to comment out the preceding solution, or the server will keep responding with a string.

```javascript
var express = require("express");
var app = express();

app.get("/", function (req, res) {
  res.sendFile(__dirname + "/views/index.html");
});

module.exports = app;
```
